# Members Module UI Revamp – Progress Log

| Date       | Status | Notes / Next Steps |
|------------|--------|--------------------|
| 2025-XX-XX | ▶️ Planned | Captured the comprehensive UX requirements from the blueprint. Created `docs/members-ui-revamp-plan.md` outlining milestones (layout, sections, right-rail, sticky actions). No code changes started yet. |
| —          | —      | **Next:** Start with Architecture & Layout Foundation tasks (sticky header/footer, two-column grid, section tabs) before refactoring individual sections. |
| 2025-XX-XX | 🧩 In progress | Extracted `SummaryCards`, `AuditTrailCard`, and `AvatarCard` helper components from `frontend/src/pages/Members/Edit.tsx` to shrink the main render tree ahead of the layout rewrite. Added rollback guidance to the plan doc (feature branches, tagging, per-commit reverts). Next up: finish modularizing the remaining sidebar blocks and drop in the new layout scaffold. |
| 2025-XX-XX | ✅ Layout shell | Added the new scaffold: sticky header/footer, section nav, two-column grid with sidebar, `QuickActionsCard`, and the right-rail `SnapshotCard`. The existing form lives inside a `Card` until the section-by-section refactor. Next up: reflow Identity/Sunday School/Membership sections into the new card/accordion format. |
| 2025-XX-XX | ♻️ Identity + Sunday School | Converted the Identity block to the new `SectionCard` pattern (collapsible, sticky-nav aware) with inline age callout and status controls. Added the dedicated Sunday School card that surfaces participant stats, payment history, and shortcuts into the schools workspace; wired quick actions + snapshot KPIs to live data. Began wiring `hasUnsavedChanges` tracking and section refs for the remaining form blocks. Next: refactor Contact → Notes sections into collapsible cards and finish tying the nav pills to collapse state. |
| 2025-XX-XX | 🔁 Contact → Notes | Finished the remaining left-rail sections: Contact/Address, Household, Giving, Payments, Family, Tags/Ministries, and Notes now share the `SectionCard` wrapper with collapse toggles wired to the nav pills. Children editor gained compact cards, tags/ministries use chip selectors, payments + notes sit inside accordions, and `hasUnsavedChanges` drives the sticky footer + Cancel reset. Next: tighten sidebar KPIs/avatar block and validate behavior once more before QA. |
| 2025-XX-XX | 🎯 Sidebar polish | Refreshed the right rail: avatar uploader now uses the circular preview/CTA pattern, quick actions gained descriptions + icons, and the snapshot card highlights age, contribution health, Sunday School stats, and last payment dates. Updated `docs/members-ui-revamp-plan.md` to mark the right-rail items complete and re-ran `pnpm --dir frontend build` to verify the bundle. Next: final QA + integration notes. |
| 2025-XX-XX | ♾️ Auto status | Wired backend membership status to contribution payments (new columns, service, override flag) and exposed `membership_health`/`membership_events` in the API. Frontend now shows the Membership Health card, payment countdown, override controls (Admin/Finance only), and a renewal/overdue activity feed above the payment timeline. |
