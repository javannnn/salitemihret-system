# Tasks: Core Plan

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-core-plan/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories)

**Tests**: Follow the constitution mandate for testing-first delivery‚Äîwrite failing tests before coding and keep them green thereafter.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story so each increment is independently implementable and testable.

**Branch Naming**: Use `feat/SPEC-<ID>-<slug>` for each spec deliverable (e.g., `feat/SPEC-AUTH-001-rbac-baseline`).

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- Backend (Frappe): `server/apps/salitemihret/`
- Frontend (React admin): `web/src/`
- Contracts: `contracts/`
- Tests: `server/apps/salitemihret/tests/`, `web/src/**/__tests__/`

---

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Establish project scaffolding, baseline tooling, and shared understanding before implementation.

## Dependencies & Execution Order

**Phase Dependencies**
- Setup (Phase 1) ‚Üí prerequisite for Foundational work (enables SPEC-AUTH-001 onward).
- Foundational (Phase 2) ‚Üí prerequisite for all spec deliverables (SPEC-AUTH-001 through SPEC-REP-001).
- User Stories (Phases 3‚Äì11) ‚Üí execute in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3) once Phase 2 completes.
- Polish (Phase 12) ‚Üí begins after desired user stories are code-complete; covers SPEC-OPS-001 and SPEC-UX-001.

**User Story Dependencies**
- **US1 (P1)**: SPEC-AUTH-001 / SPEC-AUTH-002, independent once foundational work lands; enables security hooks for later specs.
- **US2 (P1)**: SPEC-MBR-001 / SPEC-MBR-002 depend on US1 RBAC; otherwise standalone.
- **US3 (P1)**: SPEC-PAY-001 depends on US1 audit hooks; independent from US2.
- **US4 (P2)**: SPEC-SPN-001 / SPEC-NEW-001 depend on US1 authentication; optional read-only member data from US2.
- **US5 (P2)**: SPEC-SCH-001 depends on US1 authentication; leverages member data but testable with fixtures.
- **US6 (P2)**: SPEC-VOL-001 depends on US1 authentication; otherwise standalone.
- **US7 (P3)**: SPEC-MED-001 depends on US1; optional member info from US2 mocked for tests.
- **US8 (P3)**: SPEC-COU-001 depends on US1; no other blocking dependencies.
- **US9 (P3)**: SPEC-REP-001 depends on data sources from earlier specs; implement adapters progressively.

**Within Each User Story**
- Write tests (tasks marked as tests) before implementing services/UI.
- Model DocTypes before services.
- Services before API endpoints.
- Backend endpoints before frontend integrations.

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)
1. Complete Phase 1 (Setup).
2. Complete Phase 2 (Foundational).
3. Execute Phase 3 (SPEC-AUTH-001 / SPEC-AUTH-002) on branch `feat/SPEC-AUTH-001-rbac-baseline` or `feat/SPEC-AUTH-002-audit-events`.
4. Demonstrate secure access as the initial MVP.

### Incremental Delivery
1. Foundation ready (Phases 1‚Äì2).
2. Deliver P1 specs (SPEC-AUTH-001, SPEC-AUTH-002, SPEC-MBR-001, SPEC-MBR-002, SPEC-PAY-001) sequentially, validating after each checkpoint.
3. Layer P2 specs (SPEC-SPN-001, SPEC-NEW-001, SPEC-SCH-001, SPEC-VOL-001), ensuring each passes independent tests before merge.
4. Finish with P3 specs (SPEC-MED-001, SPEC-COU-001, SPEC-REP-001) before entering Polish tasks (SPEC-OPS-001, SPEC-UX-001).

### Parallel Team Strategy
1. Team collaborates on Phases 1‚Äì2.
2. After US1 completes, assign:
   - Developer A: SPEC-MBR-001 then SPEC-SCH-001.
   - Developer B: SPEC-MBR-002 then SPEC-SPN-001.
   - Developer C: SPEC-PAY-001 then SPEC-VOL-001.
   - Developer D: SPEC-NEW-001 then SPEC-MED-001 and SPEC-COU-001.
   - Reporting specialist: SPEC-REP-001 with support from earlier specs.
3. Converge on Phase 12 for cross-cutting work and release readiness (SPEC-OPS-001, SPEC-UX-001).

## Notes

- Tasks marked [P] are safe to execute in parallel when prerequisites are complete.
- Story labels ([US1]‚Ä¶[US9]) and spec tags ensure traceability to SPEC-* acceptance criteria.
- Maintain testing-first discipline‚Äîkeep the suite green between tasks.
- Stop at checkpoints to demo or validate increments independently.
