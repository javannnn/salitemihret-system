# Product Vision

## Mission Statement
SaliteMihret System equips the Ethiopian Orthodox diaspora community with a
secure, auditable, and multilingual membership platform that streamlines parish
record keeping, pastoral care, and public relations outreach. The system
captures the full member journey—from newcomer intake to sustained
contribution—while giving ministry leaders real-time insight into engagement,
program participation, and financial stewardship.

## Product Scope
### In Scope
- Digitized management of parish membership records, sponsorships, and payment
  history for internal administrative use.
- Workflow support for pastoral relationship (PR) teams, education ministries,
  volunteer coordinators, media staff, and council leaders.
- Operational tooling for data import, verification, translation, reporting,
  and audit logging within the internal system.
- Secure publication pipeline that transforms approved media content into
  curated posts for the public website feed.

### Out of Scope
- Public-facing website content management beyond the automated publishing feed.
- Congregation mobile application or ticketing experiences.
- Payment gateway integration (payments are recorded after processing in
  external banking tools).
- Third-party CRM synchronization prior to Phase 2 integrations roadmap.
